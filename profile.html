    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Rahul — a passionate B.Tech student with a love for tech, coding, and building ideas that solve real problems. Currently exploring DSA, networking, and all things software! Let's connect and grow together.

        From developing an interest in Artificial Intelligence back in 11th grade to now pursuing a B.Tech, my journey in tech has been all about curiosity, innovation, and continuous learning. 
        
        I love solving problems, building projects, and exploring new technologies that push the boundaries of what’s possible.
        
        💡 What Inspires Me?
        I’m deeply interested in AI/ML, Data Structures, and Game Development. Whether it's training AI models, crafting intelligent applications, or coding immersive experiences, I thrive on the challenge of bringing ideas to life.
        
        🏫 Education & Learning
        I completed my schooling at Universe Public Sr. Sec. School, where my passion for AI sparked. Since then, I’ve dived deep into coding, learning C, C++, Python, and exploring fields like Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, and Reinforcement Learning.
        
        🏸 Beyond Tech – My Hobbies
        When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me playing chess, hitting the badminton court, or exploring new strategies in competitive games. I believe that strategic thinking in sports translates well into problem-solving in tech!
        
        🤝 Let’s Connect & Build Together!
        I strongly believe in collaboration and teamwork, as great ideas come to life when people share knowledge and work together. I’m looking for internship and job opportunities where I can contribute, learn from experts, and create meaningful impact.
        
        If you share my passion or have exciting opportunities, feel free to connect. Let’s innovate and grow together! 🚀💻</p>
